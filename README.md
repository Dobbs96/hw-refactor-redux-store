# Redux Store

## Description

The app is a full running e-commerce platform. I will refactor the website so it will use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The app will also be deployed onto Heroku for use. With some knownledge of redux i will need to use the documentation to help.

Check out the [live app](**inserLiveLink here**)
